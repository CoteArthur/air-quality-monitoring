This application consists of periodic sendings of a modbus frame to each of the [E4000 Air Quality Probe](http://nano-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E4000NG-advanced-datasheet.pdf) installed as well as management of the data received and the storage of these in the database.

_This project was made in group, it is not whole as it is since this repo is meant to showcase my personal work done for portfolio purposes._
